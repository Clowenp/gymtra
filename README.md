# Gymtra

Gymtra is an all-in-one fitness planner app that allows beginners to feel comfortable at the gym by providing a large catalogue of exercises to plan with.
It provides detailed information and tours about various gym equipment and exercise. Moreover, it uses progress tracking to discourage people from focusing too much on short-term changes (when they don't see instantaneous changes).
